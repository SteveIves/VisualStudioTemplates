    <h1>Device Licensing App (Universal Windows)</h1>

    <hr/>

    <p>
        The project that you have created includes a reference implementation of the Synergy
        Device Licensing technologies. Before you can build the project for the first time you
        will need to edit the source file LicenseClass.dbl (you will find it in the projects
        DeviceLicensing folder) and provide appropriate values for the AppGUID and PublicKey
        properties of the SynergyDeviceLicense attribute.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can obtain the correct values for these properties by logging in to the Device Licensing
        Portal, part of the <a href="https://synergexresourcecenter.force.com">Synergy Resource Center</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The project will not build until you have provided appropriate values for these two properties.
