This project was created from a project template that includes a reference implementation
of Synergy Device Licensing. Before you can build the project for the first time you will
need to edit the included source file DeviceLicensing\LicenseClass.dbl and alter the
SynergyDeviceLicense attribute, providing values for:

 - AppGUID
 - PublicKey

 These attribute properties must be populated with actual data obtained from the Synergy
 Device Licensing Portal at https://synergexresourcecenter.force.com
